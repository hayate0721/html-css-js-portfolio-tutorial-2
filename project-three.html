            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>This project involves creating a chatbot using Amazon Lex, which can translate text provided by the user into a selected language using Amazon Translate. The chatbot captures user intents, extracts necessary information through slots, and delivers the translated text as output.</p>

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amazon Lex:</strong> For creating the chatbot and defining user intents.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon Translate:</strong> For translating text from one language to another.</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> To execute the translation logic based on the data captured by Lex.</li>
                <li><strong>AWS CLI:</strong> For interacting with AWS services during development.</li>
                <li><strong>Python:</strong> For the programming logic that integrates Lex with Translate via Lambda.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Project Steps</h2>
            <p>To complete this project, the following steps were taken:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Created a chatbot in Amazon Lex and defined clear user intents.</li>
                <li>Specified utterances that users might say to interact with the bot.</li>
                <li>Defined slots within the intents, such as "language" and "text," to capture the necessary information for translation.</li>
                <li>Developed an AWS Lambda function to take the captured slot data and perform a translation using Amazon Translate.</li>
                <li>Integrated the Lambda function with the Lex chatbot to deliver the translated text to the user.</li>
                <li>Tested the chatbot to ensure it could accurately capture user input, translate the text, and return the correct output.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="output">
            <h2>Output</h2>
            <p>The output consists of the translated text provided by the chatbot based on the user's input. The translation is performed in real-time using Amazon Translate, and the results are displayed back to the user via the chatbot interface.</p>
